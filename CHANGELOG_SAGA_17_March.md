# Saga Pattern Implementation Changelog

## Version: 1.0.0 (March 17, 2025)

This changelog documents the implementation of the Saga pattern for order creation in the CampusG food delivery application.

### Added

#### Core Saga Orchestrator

- **services/order_service/app/sagas/create_order_saga.py**
  - Implemented the main Saga orchestrator class that coordinates the order creation workflow
  - Added 20-step flow with proper error handling and compensating transactions
  - Integrated with User Service, Payment Service, Escrow Service, and Scheduler Service
  - Added Kafka event publishing for notifications at key steps
  - Implemented order status management

#### Scheduler Service

- **services/scheduler-service/app/api/scheduler_routes.py**
  - Added `/schedule` endpoint for creating timeout events
  - Added `/events/<event_id>/cancel` endpoint for canceling scheduled events
  - Added `/events` endpoint for retrieving scheduled events
  - Implemented validation and error handling

- **services/scheduler-service/app/models/models.py**
  - Created `ScheduledEvent` model for storing timeout events
  - Added fields for event type, entity ID, scheduled time, payload, and status
  - Implemented serialization method for API responses

#### Payment Service

- **services/payment-service/app/api/payment_routes.py**
  - Added `/payments/authorize` endpoint for authorizing payments via Stripe
  - Added `/payments/release` endpoint for releasing payment authorizations
  - Added `/payments/capture` endpoint for capturing authorized payments
  - Added `/payments/<payment_id>` and `/payments` endpoints for retrieving payment information
  - Implemented validation, error handling, and Stripe integration placeholders

- **services/payment-service/app/models/models.py**
  - Created `Payment` model for storing payment records
  - Added `PaymentStatus` enum for tracking payment lifecycle
  - Implemented fields for order ID, customer ID, amount, and Stripe integration
  - Added serialization method for API responses

#### Escrow Service

- **services/escrow-service/app/api/escrow_routes.py**
  - Added `/escrow/hold` endpoint for placing funds in escrow
  - Added `/escrow/release` endpoint for releasing funds to restaurants and runners
  - Added `/escrow/cancel` endpoint for canceling escrow holds
  - Added `/escrow/<escrow_id>` and `/escrow` endpoints for retrieving escrow information
  - Implemented validation, error handling, and integration with Payment Service

- **services/escrow-service/app/models/models.py**
  - Created `EscrowTransaction` model for storing escrow transactions
  - Added `TransactionType` and `TransactionStatus` enums for tracking transaction lifecycle
  - Implemented fields for order ID, customer ID, amount, food fee, delivery fee, and recipient type
  - Added serialization method for API responses

### Architecture Details

The implementation follows a choreography-based saga pattern with the following flow:

1. Get user data from User Service
2. Create order record in Order Service
3. Log pending payment to Kafka notification service
4. Authorize payment via Payment Service
5. Log payment authorization to Kafka notification service
6. Hold funds in Escrow Service
7. Log escrow placement to Kafka notification service
8. Update order status to "created" in Order Service
9. Log status update to Kafka notification service
10. Start order timeout timer in Scheduler Service

### Compensating Transactions

The implementation includes proper compensating transactions:

- If payment authorization fails: Cancel the order
- If escrow hold fails: Release payment authorization and cancel the order
- If scheduler setup fails: Proceed with order but log an error

### Next Steps

The following components still need to be implemented:

1. User Service endpoint for retrieving user data
2. Kafka consumer in the Notification Service to handle events
3. Scheduler worker that processes timeout events
4. Accept Order and Complete Order sagas

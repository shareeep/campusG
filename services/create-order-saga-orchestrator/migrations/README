# Database Migrations

Generic single-database configuration with Alembic.

## Overview

This directory contains the database migrations for the Create Order Saga Orchestrator service.
These migrations will be automatically applied when the service starts up.

## Migration Structure

- `alembic.ini`: Alembic configuration file
- `env.py`: Environment setup for migrations
- `script.py.mako`: Template for migration scripts
- `versions/`: Contains individual migration script files
  - `001_initial_schema.py`: Initial database schema with ENUM types and tables

## Manual Execution

To run migrations manually (if needed):

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

To create a new migration after model changes:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Description of changes"

# Payment Service Integration Testing Changelog (March 31, 2025)

## Overview

This changelog documents the successful testing and verification of the Payment Service's integration with both Kafka and Stripe. The testing confirms that the Payment Service properly:

1. Receives and processes commands from Kafka
2. Interacts with Stripe to authorize payments
3. Publishes response events back to Kafka

## Testing Completed

- ✅ Verified Kafka connectivity
- ✅ Successfully received and processed `authorize_payment` commands
- ✅ Created Stripe Payment Intents
- ✅ Published response events back to Kafka
- ✅ Confirmed Stripe webhook integration with ngrok

## Key Implementation Details

### Kafka Integration

- The Payment Service correctly consumes messages from the `payment_commands` topic
- It processes `authorize_payment` commands from the Create Order Saga Orchestrator
- It publishes `payment.authorized` and `payment.failed` events to the `payment_events` topic
- All events include the proper `correlation_id` for traceability

### Stripe Integration

- The Payment Service successfully creates PaymentIntents with Stripe
- It uses the `stripeCustomerId` from the payload for customer identification
- It properly implements escrow functionality using Stripe's `capture_method: 'manual'`
- Payment Intents are authorized and held for later capture/release

### Database Storage

- Payment records are properly created in the database
- Status transitions are correctly tracked
- Payment Intent IDs from Stripe are stored for future operations

## Important Configuration Notes

1. **Stripe Requirements**:
   - Discovered that Stripe requires a `return_url` parameter when the dashboard has redirect-based payment methods enabled
   - Alternative configuration: Set `automatic_payment_methods[enabled]` to `true` and `automatic_payment_methods[allow_redirects]` to `never`

2. **Database Schema**:
   - The database schema was successfully created using `db.create_all()`
   - No manual migrations needed

## Event-Driven Architecture

The Payment Service now functions in a fully event-driven manner:

```
Create Order Saga Orchestrator → Kafka → Payment Service → Stripe → Payment Service → Kafka → Create Order Saga Orchestrator
```

Direct API endpoints for `/authorize`, `/release`, and `/revert` have been removed in favor of this event-driven approach.

## Next Steps

1. Implement webhook processing for payment status updates
2. Complete the release and revert payment flows
3. Enhance error handling and retry mechanisms

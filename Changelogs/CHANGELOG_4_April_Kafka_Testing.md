# Kafka Integration Testing Between Order Service and Saga Orchestrator

**Date: April 4, 2025**

## Overview

This update documents the testing of Kafka integration between the Order Service and Create-Order-Saga-Orchestrator. The tests verify bidirectional communication through Kafka, ensuring that events and commands can be properly exchanged between these services.

## Testing Scripts Created

1. **Order Service → Kafka → Saga Orchestrator**
   - Created `test_kafka_publish.py` in the Order Service to send test events
   - Verified receipt of events at the Saga Orchestrator

2. **Saga Orchestrator → Kafka → Order Service**
   - Created `test_kafka_command.py` in the Create-Order-Saga-Orchestrator to send test commands
   - Verified receipt of commands at the Order Service

## Test Results

### Order to Saga Test

Successfully verified the flow:
```
# Order Service sending event:
Publishing test message to order_events with correlation_id test-20250404120407...
Message sent successfully

# Saga Orchestrator receiving event:
Received event order.created from order_events with correlation_id test-20250404120407
```

### Saga to Order Test

Successfully verified the flow:
```
# Saga Orchestrator sending command:
Publishing test command to order_commands with correlation_id test-saga-20250404120456...
Command sent successfully

# Order Service receiving command:
Received command update_order_status from order_commands with correlation_id test-saga-20250404120456
```

## Validation of Configuration

- Confirmed both services are properly connecting to Kafka at `kafka:9092`
- Validated message serialization and deserialization
- Verified proper topic subscription and publishing
- Confirmed correlation IDs are maintained throughout the message flow

## Next Steps

These tests confirm that the Kafka messaging infrastructure is properly set up between the Order Service and Create-Order-Saga-Orchestrator. The next step would be to implement the actual business logic handlers for these messages to complete the saga pattern implementation.

Note: The warning messages about "No handler registered" are expected in the test environment since we're just testing the messaging infrastructure without implementing actual business logic handlers.

# CHANGELOG: April 7, 2025 - Kafka Integration Complete

## Changes Made

1. **Standardized Kafka Topic Naming Convention**
   - Ensured all Kafka topics use consistent underscore naming format (`topic_name` instead of `topic-name`)
   - Created missing topics with proper naming:
     - `payment_commands`
     - `timer_commands`
     - `escrow_events`
     - `notification_events`

2. **Updated Notification Service Configuration**
   - Modified Kafka consumer to listen exclusively to underscore-formatted topics
   - Removed legacy hyphenated topic names from consumer configuration
   - Verified notification database captures events from all properly named topics

3. **Fixed Comprehensive Test Script**
   - Updated API endpoint paths in the test script
   - Improved error handling for notification service tests

## Why These Changes Were Needed

These changes resolved the integration issues between services by ensuring consistent Kafka topic naming throughout the system. Previously, some services were publishing to hyphenated topics while others were expecting underscore-formatted topics, causing message delivery failures and broken event chains.

## Verification

The fix has been verified by running comprehensive tests that simulate the entire order creation and cancellation flows. All events are now properly captured by the notification service, and the complete saga flow works end-to-end with no message loss.

## Testing Guide for Team Members

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Project repository cloned

### Step 1: Start the System
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for services to be healthy (about 2-3 minutes)
docker-compose ps
```

### Step 2: Verify Kafka Topics
```bash
# List all Kafka topics to verify naming convention
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```
Verify that you see all topics with underscore naming (`order_events`, `payment_commands`, etc.)

### Step 3: Run the Comprehensive Test
```bash
# Navigate to the saga orchestrator directory
cd services/create-order-saga-orchestrator

# Run the comprehensive test
python comprehensive_test.py --docker
```
The test should run without errors and show "ðŸŽ‰ Create Order Saga Test Flow completed successfully!" and "ðŸŽ‰ Order Cancellation Test Flow completed successfully!"

### Step 4: Verify Notifications
```bash
# Check that notifications were captured from the underscore-formatted topics
docker-compose exec notification-db psql -U postgres -d notification_db -c "SELECT source_topic, COUNT(*) FROM notifications GROUP BY source_topic ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;"
```
You should see counts for all underscore-formatted topics like `order_events`, `payment_events`, etc.

### Step 5: Manual Testing (Optional)
If you want to manually test the flow:

1. Use the create order API endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3101/orders -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"customer_id": "cust_test123", "order_details": {"foodItems": [{"name": "Test Burger", "price": 15.99, "quantity": 1}], "deliveryLocation": "Test Location"}}'
```

2. Note the saga_id from the response and check its status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3101/sagas/{saga_id}
```

3. Verify notifications captured in the database:
```bash
docker-compose exec notification-db psql -U postgres -d notification_db -c "SELECT created_at, source_topic, event_type, order_id FROM notifications WHERE correlation_id='{saga_id}' ORDER BY created_at ASC;"
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check service health**: `docker-compose ps` to verify all services are running
2. **Check logs**: `docker-compose logs -f notification-service` to see logs for specific services
3. **Restart individual services**: `docker-compose restart notification-service` if needed
4. **Verify Kafka topics**: Ensure all required topics exist with the correct naming

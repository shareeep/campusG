# Order Service Kafka Integration

**Date: April 4, 2025**

## Overview

This update establishes proper Kafka integration for the Order Service, enabling it to communicate with other microservices through Kafka. The Order Service can now publish order events to Kafka and consume order command messages from the Create-Order-Saga-Orchestrator and other services.

## Changes

1. **Requirements Update**
   - Replaced `confluent-kafka` with `kafka-python==2.0.2` for consistency with other microservices

2. **Implemented Full Kafka Service**
   - Replaced the no-op Kafka service with a complete implementation using `kafka-python`
   - Added connection logic for both producers and consumers
   - Implemented event publishing functionality
   - Added command subscription and handling

3. **Standardized Kafka Configuration**
   - Configured the service to use `kafka:9092` as the bootstrap server address
   - Added environment variables in docker-compose.yml
   - Added Kafka dependency in docker-compose.yml

4. **Application Integration**
   - Updated run.py to properly initialize Kafka
   - Added proper shutdown handling

## Event Types

The Order Service now produces the following events:
- `order.created` - When a new order is created
- `order.updated` - When order details are updated
- `order.status_changed` - When order status changes

And listens for the following commands:
- Commands on the `order_commands` topic

## Architecture Notes

The updated architecture follows the event-driven pattern:
1. Order Service can publish events to Kafka
2. Saga Orchestrators can consume these events
3. Saga Orchestrators can send commands back to the Order Service
4. Order Service executes the commands and publishes resulting events

This completes the event flow:
Order Service → Kafka → Create-Order-Saga-Orchestrator → Kafka → Order Service

## Testing

The changes can be tested by:
1. Starting the services with `docker-compose up`
2. Creating a new order via the Order Service API
3. Verifying that the Create-Order-Saga-Orchestrator receives the event
4. Checking that the saga process completes successfully

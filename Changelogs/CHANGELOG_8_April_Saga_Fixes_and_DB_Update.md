# Changelog - April 8, 2025: Create Order Saga Fixes & Database Update

This document summarizes recent fixes applied to the Create Order Saga Orchestrator and provides instructions for updating the local database schema to support these changes.

## Summary of Changes:

1.  **Saga Final State Handling:**
    *   Implemented event handlers for `payment.released` and `order.cancelled` in the orchestrator.
    *   Added logic (`_check_and_complete_compensation_or_cancellation`) to correctly transition sagas to the final `COMPENSATED` or `CANCELLED` states upon receiving these confirmation events.
    *   Added `order_cancelled_confirmed` and `payment_reverted_confirmed` boolean columns to the `CreateOrderSagaState` model to track these confirmations.

2.  **Compensation Logic Improvement:**
    *   Modified the compensation logic in `handle_order_status_update_failed` to be more robust. It now attempts to:
        *   Revert payment (via `revert_payment` command).
        *   Cancel the order (via `cancel_order` command).
        *   Cancel the external timer (via HTTP call).
    *   The saga will now only transition to `COMPENSATED` in this scenario after *both* payment revert and order cancellation are confirmed.

3.  **Manual Cancellation Enhancement:**
    *   Modified the `POST /sagas/{saga_id}/cancel` API endpoint and the internal `_initiate_cancellation` logic to allow cancellation attempts on sagas that are in the `COMPLETED` state. This allows users to try cancelling an order even after the initial creation flow succeeded, relying on the Order Service to ultimately accept or reject the cancellation based on the actual order status.
    *   The API now returns a 409 Conflict if attempting to cancel a saga already in `CANCELLING`, `CANCELLED`, `FAILED`, or `COMPENSATED` state.

4.  **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Fixed a `NameError: name 'PaymentStatus' is not defined` in `handle_payment_released` by comparing against the string literal `'REVERTED'`.
    *   Fixed a `sqlalchemy.exc.DataError: ... invalid input value for enum sagastatus` by adding the missing enum values (`COMPENSATING`, `COMPENSATED`, `CANCELLING`, `CANCELLED`) to the `sagastatus` enum type directly in the PostgreSQL database.

## Database Update Instructions for Teammates:

The recent changes require updates to the `create_order_saga_db` database schema. Please follow these steps **after pulling the latest code changes**:

1.  **Ensure Docker Compose is running:** Make sure your Docker containers (including `create-order-saga-db`) are running (`docker compose up -d`).
2.  **Add New Columns:** Run the following command in your terminal from the project root directory (`campusG`) to add the necessary boolean flags to the `create_order_saga_states` table:
    ```bash
    docker compose exec -T create-order-saga-db psql -U postgres -d create_order_saga_db -c "ALTER TABLE create_order_saga_states ADD COLUMN order_cancelled_confirmed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE, ADD COLUMN payment_reverted_confirmed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;"
    ```
    *(You might see a notice like "ALTER TABLE" if the command succeeds. If you encounter errors about columns already existing, you might have partially applied these changes before).*

3.  **Add Missing Enum Values:** Run the following commands **one by one** in your terminal (from the project root) to add the missing status values to the `sagastatus` enum type. Running them individually prevents errors if a value already exists:
    ```bash
    # Command 1
    docker compose exec -T create-order-saga-db psql -U postgres -d create_order_saga_db -c "ALTER TYPE sagastatus ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'COMPENSATING';"

    # Command 2
    docker compose exec -T create-order-saga-db psql -U postgres -d create_order_saga_db -c "ALTER TYPE sagastatus ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'COMPENSATED';"

    # Command 3
    docker compose exec -T create-order-saga-db psql -U postgres -d create_order_saga_db -c "ALTER TYPE sagastatus ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'CANCELLING';"

    # Command 4
    docker compose exec -T create-order-saga-db psql -U postgres -d create_order_saga_db -c "ALTER TYPE sagastatus ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'CANCELLED';"
    ```
    *(You should see "ALTER TYPE" after each successful command).*

4.  **Restart Orchestrator Service:** Rebuild and restart the orchestrator to ensure it uses the updated code and connects to the updated database schema:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build create-order-saga-orchestrator
    ```

5.  **Add `payment_id` Column (Flask-Migrate):** An earlier change added the `payment_id` column to the `CreateOrderSagaState` model to support payment reverts. Apply this change using Flask-Migrate:
    *   **Generate Migration Script:**
        ```bash
        docker compose exec create-order-saga-orchestrator flask db migrate -m "Add payment_id to CreateOrderSagaState"
        ```
        *(This should detect the added column and create a new file in `services/create-order-saga-orchestrator/migrations/versions/`)*
    *   **Apply Migration:**
        ```bash
        docker compose exec create-order-saga-orchestrator flask db upgrade
        ```
        *(This applies the generated script to the database, adding the column. You should see output indicating the upgrade ran successfully).*
    *   **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter errors during migration (e.g., `Can't locate revision identified by...` or `Directory migrations already exists...`), it might indicate an inconsistent state. Try these steps:
        *   Drop the Alembic version table: `docker compose exec create-order-saga-db psql -U postgres -d create_order_saga_db -c "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS alembic_version;"`
        *   Initialize migrations if needed (might error if dir exists): `docker compose exec create-order-saga-orchestrator flask db init`
        *   Retry the `migrate` and `upgrade` commands above.

After completing all these steps, your local environment should be up-to-date with the latest saga orchestrator fixes and database schema.

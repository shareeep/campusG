# Changelog - April 1, 2025 - User Service Complete Integration

This changelog provides a detailed overview of all changes made to integrate the User Service with the payment flow and Kafka messaging system.

## Overview

The User Service has been enhanced to fully support the payment flow:

```
User Service → Kafka (user_events) → Create Order Saga → Kafka (payment_commands) → Payment Service → Stripe
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Stripe Customer Creation
- Modified `services/user-service/app/api/user_routes.py` to automatically create Stripe Customer objects when users register
- Added error handling and logging for Stripe API interactions
- Updated the `handle_user_created` function to store the returned `stripe_customer_id` in the User database record

### 2. Database Schema Update
- Identified and resolved a missing `stripe_customer_id` column issue in the `users` table
- Used Flask-Migrate to generate and apply a migration that adds the missing column

### 3. Kafka Integration
- Standardized to `kafka-python` library (replacing `confluent-kafka`) for consistency with other services
- Created a robust implementation of `services/user-service/app/services/kafka_service.py`:
  - Added a producer for publishing events to the `user_events` topic
  - Added a consumer to listen on the `user_commands` topic
  - Implemented resilient error handling for message parsing and processing
  - Added structured logging for debugging

### 4. Message Processing
- Implemented logic to process `get_user_payment_info` requests, including:
  - Validating request parameters
  - Retrieving user data from the database
  - Checking for required payment information (Stripe Customer ID and payment method)
  - Formatting and publishing appropriate responses
- Added logic to handle and log different error scenarios:
  - User not found
  - Missing Stripe Customer ID
  - Missing payment method information
  - General processing errors

### 5. Application Integration
- Updated `services/user-service/app/__init__.py` to initialize and start the Kafka service when the application starts
- Added Flask application context handling in the Kafka service

### 6. Documentation
- Created `PAYMENT_DATA_GUIDE.md` detailing the required data structures for Kafka messaging
- Created `USER_CREATION_GUIDE.md` explaining the user registration flow and Stripe integration
- Created `KAFKA_TESTING_GUIDE.md` with step-by-step instructions to verify the Kafka integration

### 7. Testing
- Successfully tested user creation via simulated Clerk webhook
- Tested the Kafka integration with message production and consumption
- Verified correct error reporting for missing payment methods

## Technical Details

### Message Structure

The User Service now publishes messages to Kafka with this structure:

```json
{
  "type": "user.payment_info_retrieved",
  "correlation_id": "<saga_id>",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "payload": {
    "customer": {
      "clerkUserId": "<clerk_user_id>",
      "stripeCustomerId": "<stripe_customer_id>",
      "userStripeCard": {
        "payment_method_id": "<payment_method_id>",
        "card_type": "visa",
        "last_four": "4242"
      }
    },
    "order": {
      "amount": 1299,
      "description": "Food delivery order"
    }
  },
  "source": "user-service"
}
```

Or for error scenarios:

```json
{
  "type": "user.payment_info_failed",
  "correlation_id": "<saga_id>",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "payload": {
    "error": "Default payment method not set for user"
  },
  "source": "user-service"
}
```

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding transaction support for Stripe Customer creation to ensure database consistency
- Implement periodic retry logic for failed Stripe API calls
- Add monitoring for Kafka connectivity and message processing
- Consider adding a dead-letter queue for messages that consistently fail processing

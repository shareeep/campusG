# CampusG Project Structure Guide

This document explains the project structure that has been set up for the CampusG food delivery application.

## Project Overview

CampusG is a microservices-based food delivery application designed for campus environments. The application follows three key sagas:
1. Create Order Saga
2. Accept Order Saga
3. Complete Order Saga

The project has been structured with 6 microservices, a message broker (Kafka), and a Next.js frontend.

## Core Services

1. **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and profiles (TypeScript/Node.js)
2. **Order Service**: Handles order creation and lifecycle management (Python/Flask)
3. **Payment Service**: Processes payments via Stripe (TypeScript/Node.js)
4. **Escrow Service**: Manages fund holding and release (TypeScript/Node.js)
5. **Scheduler Service**: Handles time-based events and order timeouts (TypeScript/Node.js)
6. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users (TypeScript/Node.js)

## Project Root Files

- **README.md**: Project documentation with setup instructions
- **docker-compose.yml**: Orchestrates all services (databases, Kafka, microservices, frontend)
  - Configures PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Zookeeper
  - Sets up each microservice with appropriate environment variables
  - Links the services together and exposes necessary ports

- **scripts/create-multiple-db.sh**: Helper script for creating multiple PostgreSQL databases
  - Used by the docker-compose.yml to initialize a separate database for each service

## Microservice Structure

## What Needs To Be Implemented

This structure provides the foundation for your application. Here's what you need to implement:

### For TypeScript Microservices:

1. **Create Missing Files**:
   - Create `index.ts` in each service as the entry point (like in the user service)
   - Create config files with environment variables and service URLs
   - Implement controllers for API endpoints
   - Create route definitions to expose APIs
   - Implement Kafka message handlers in services

2. **Complete Business Logic**:
   - Implement user authentication with Clerk
   - Implement payment processing with Stripe
   - Build escrow logic for fund holding
   - Create scheduling logic for timeouts
   - Implement notification delivery

### For Flask Order Service:

1. **Complete the Implementation**:
   - The service has already been set up with the essential structure
   - Complete the API endpoints for order management
   - Implement the Accept Order and Complete Order sagas
   - Add additional error handling and validation

### For the Frontend:

1. **Create Pages**:
   - Customer dashboard
   - Runner dashboard
   - Order creation and tracking
   - User profile and settings

2. **Implement API Clients**:
   - Create service clients to communicate with backend services
   - Implement real-time updates with WebSockets

3. **Build UI Components**:
   - Create forms for order creation
   - Build order tracking components
   - Implement notification displays

## Special Notes on Example Files

Some files have been created as examples to guide your implementation:

1. **User Service** (TypeScript):
   - `src/config/index.ts`: Shows how to set up configuration
   - `src/controllers/userController.ts`: Demonstrates controller implementation
   - `src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts`: Shows Clerk authentication
   - `src/routes/userRoutes.ts`: Demonstrates route definition
   - `src/services/kafkaService.ts`: Shows Kafka integration
   - `src/index.ts`: Demonstrates the main application entry point

2. **Order Service** (Flask):
   - `app/sagas/create_order_saga.py`: Demonstrates the Saga pattern implementation
   - `app/api/routes.py`: Shows API endpoint implementation
   - `app/models/models.py`: Shows SQLAlchemy model definitions
   - `app/services/kafka_service.py`: Shows Kafka integration in Python

These files are just examples and should be modified to fit your specific requirements.

## Saga Pattern Implementation

The saga pattern is implemented in both TypeScript and Python, demonstrating how to:

1. Orchestrate a complex workflow across multiple services
2. Include compensating transactions for error handling
3. Publish events to Kafka for other services to consume
4. Coordinate the order creation process from validation to notification

Follow this pattern for the other sagas:

- **Accept Order Saga**: Coordinates runner acceptance, order status update, and notifications
- **Complete Order Saga**: Coordinates delivery confirmation, payment release, and order completion

## Docker Setup

The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the entire application:

1. It sets up PostgreSQL with multiple databases
2. It configures Kafka and Zookeeper for message brokering
3. It builds and runs each microservice with appropriate environment variables
4. It links services together with the correct networking

To run the application, simply use `docker-compose up` after implementing the required functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Review the existing files to understand the structure
2. Implement the missing files for each service
3. Build out the business logic for your specific requirements
4. Test the sagas to ensure proper workflow
5. Develop the frontend user interface
6. Test the end-to-end application

This structure provides a solid foundation for your CampusG application. You can modify it as needed to fit your specific requirements.

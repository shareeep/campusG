# Changelog - 23 March 2025 (Part 2)

## Modifications to Kafka Implementation

### Changes Made

1. **Disabled Kafka and Zookeeper in docker-compose.yml**
   - Commented out Kafka and Zookeeper services
   - Removed Kafka dependencies from services' `depends_on` sections
   - Commented out Kafka-related environment variables

2. **Created No-op Kafka Client Implementations**
   - Implemented completely detached, no-op Kafka clients with no dependencies
   - Removed all references to Flask's `current_app` and logging functionality
   - Simple implementations that succeed without performing any actual operations

3. **Applied No-op Kafka Implementation to All Services**
   - Escrow Service 
   - Payment Service
   - Notification Service
   - Timer Service
   - Scheduler Service (added missing kafka_service.py)
   - Order Service (simplified KafkaService class)
   - User Service (added missing kafka_service.py)

### Implementation Details

The simplified Kafka client implementation for all services:

```python
# Completely detached no-op Kafka client

class KafkaClient:
    """No-op Kafka client that does nothing"""
    
    def __init__(self, bootstrap_servers=None):
        """Initialize the client (no-op)"""
        pass
    
    def publish(self, topic, message):
        """Pretend to publish a message (no-op)"""
        return True
    
    def close(self):
        """No-op close method"""
        pass

# Global Kafka client instance
kafka_client = KafkaClient()
```

### Notes
- These changes were made to align with the TO-DO.md guidance that "Kafka-related implementation is currently ON HOLD"
- The code structure is preserved so Kafka can be easily re-enabled in the future when needed
- These changes are part of ongoing efforts to isolate issues with service startup problems
